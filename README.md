# Detecting an object and its depth from video footage.
In order to run the program Realsense SDK 2.0 must be installed (also check out the realsense-viewer its pretty cool).The code detects the book in the 'test.bag' file used for demonstration and calculates its average depth (and prints the value).It also prints two images (color and depth) where book is detected by a bounding box.    
One can learn most of the functions present in the pyrealsense2 module from the examples in their repo.   
Files included:   
1. Depth.py  
2. Working video of the code (Depth_Capture.mp4)   
3. test.bag (reference video)
